# Spotify Automations
These are some automated tasks to improve the Spotify experience (at least for me).

## 'Recently Liked' Playlist
I have a habit of liking songs to listen to later, as opposed to putting them in a playlist. Whilst it does allow me to keep a list of all the songs I enjoy, that list of 'Liked Songs' has gotten seriously out of hand and I wanted a way to listen to my most recently liked 'Liked Songs'. So I created this script to keep a playlist updated with my 30 most recently liked songs. Much better than listening to my 'Liked Songs' in order every day....
